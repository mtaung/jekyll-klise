**Hi There!**

I'm a final year PhD candidate working on biosignal modelling of player experience and behavioural analytics at the York HCI labs. At least, that's what I was doing before the plague ruined my lab and research. Since then I've been dabbling in psychometrics and online survey research. I'm currently writing up my PhD thesis on the measurement of video game immersion.

#### Background

You can ask for my full resume by emailing me at `[myat]at[aung]dot[uk]` or reaching out to me on my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/myat-aung-315136210/). A brief overview of my background below:

**PhD, Computer Science & Human Computer Interactions** \\
*University of York, Dept. of Computer Science* \\
My PhD on the measurement of Immersion is supervised by the wonderful professors [Paul Cairns](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/people/pcairns) and [Alex Wade](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=uXek5k4AAAAJ&hl=en). As part of my training, I've also studied courses on Numerical Analysis and Econometrics & Statistics to round out my technical skills.

**MSci, Psychology: Neuroscience & Neuroimaging** \\
*University of York, Dept. of Psychology* \\
I studied for my first degree under the supervision of Dr. Rob Jenkins, at the department of Psychology. I was also guided significantly by Dr. Philip Quinlan, who supervised my reading into the effects of playing video games on sleep quality and duration. My master's thesis involved trying to systematically produce parrahippocampal gyrus responses to images that were parametrically manipulated based on their low level properties. It was a small piece of a larger body of ongoing work by Dr. Tom Hartley and Dr. David Watson. 

**Other stuff**

- I like trying to use Discord to make weird chat based social games, like [bossfight club](https://github.com/mtaung/bossfight_club) and [stonks](https://github.com/mtaung/stonks).
- I have been collaborating with Sagarika Patra at [WEAVR](https://weavr.tv/) on machine learning projects for esports in DOTA 2.
- I was a research intern with the Digital Creativity labs, working on a project in collaboration with Riot Games on skill prediction in player populations. The paper is open and can be found on [whiterose](https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/132541/).
- Much of my good fortune can be credited to [Athanasios Kokkinakis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PIX-i1EAAAAJ&hl=el) who introduced me to the concept of doing research on games at all, and I've been credited with [collecting data on some of his publications](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0186621).
- I've also done some work with [Valerio Bonometti](https://github.com/vb690) and [Anders Drachen](https://scholar.google.se/citations?user=rOcL0NgAAAAJ&hl=en) on behavioural analytics in games.
- My earliest experiences were thanks to [Jet Sanders](https://www.lse.ac.uk/PBS/People/Dr-Jet-G.Sanders), who I helped with labelling and processing of traffic data for her work on weekday effects on risk taking behaviours.
