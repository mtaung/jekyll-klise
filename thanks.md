This website is a hacked together version of [klis√©](https://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise) that has had the Tufte style margin notes translated into it from [tufte-jekyll](https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll). I'm not a web dev and these two resources were invaluable in getting this site the way I wanted, as well as help from my friend [Schrodingerskitty](https://github.com/SchrodingersKitty).
